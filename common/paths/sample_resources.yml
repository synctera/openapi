    Create sample resources, the purpose of which is two-fold:
    1. Demonstrates a range of platform capabilities
    2. Jumpstarts integrators who wish to try out more advanced functionality without first generating prerequisite resources

    This endpoint can be called at any time in sandbox and staging. It is not operational in prod.
    There is no expectation that the existing resources be inspected prior to generation of new sample resources.
