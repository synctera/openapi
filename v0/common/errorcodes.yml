# This file is NOT part of our OpenAPI spec -- it's a custom Synctera thing.
# But it is definitely part of our API, and will be used to generate both
# docs and code.
#
# The top-level members of an error spec file are: `tag`, `markdown_doc`, `error_codes`.
#
# `tag` should match a tag used in our OpenAPI spec. If you are working on
# things/errorcodes.yml, which corresponds to openapi/vX/things, then
# just use the same tag in the error spec as you use in openapi/vX/things.
#
# `markdown_doc` is an optional chunk of text used to explain this block of error codes.
# What is special about this API domain that it needs these particular error codes?
# If in doubt, leave it out.
#
# The bulk of the file is `error_codes`, an array of objects.
# Each one describes one error that can be emitted by at least one Synctera API
# endpoint. Required fields for each error object:
#
#   code:
#     machine-readable representation of this error
#   status:
#     HTTP status that will always be returned with this error
#   markdown_doc:
#     fragment of Markdown that will be assembled into documentation
#
# Optional fields:
#
#   error_type:
#     used to build a 'type' field to avoid breaking API v0 error responses
#   title:
#     used as the 'title' field for v0 responses (if absent, will be derived
#     from error_type)
#   extra_fields:
#     specifies which additional fields may be included with these errors
#
# Initially, errorcodes.yml files will have two purposes:
#
# * generate source code with error code constants (and other info)
# * generate documentation of all our error codes
#
# This file is ordered by HTTP status code, then alphabetically by error code.
# For example:
#   400 ALL_IS_NOT_WELL
#   400 BAD_THINGS_HAPPENED
#   401 AUTHENTICATION_ERROR
#   401 YOU_ARE_NOT_WELCOME

# A note on "not found" errors: the generic RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND is the only way
# we should return 404 errors: a GET /v0/<thing>/<uuid> request will return
# (404, RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND) if there is no <thing> with the specified <uuid>.
# More broadly, if the URL is bad, we should return 404 RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND.
# If there is nothing wrong with the URL, then we should NOT return 404.
# (Unfortunately, lots of v0 code gets this wrong. We should fix it in v1.)
#
# The resource-specific THING_NOT_FOUND codes are for cases where a request
# refers to another resource: trying to create an account for a non-existent
# customer, or a card for a non-existent account, etc. Ultimately, there will be
# one THING_NOT_FOUND for every resource in our API.

tag: Global Error Codes
markdown_doc: |
  Several error codes are applicable across Synctera's platform.
  Any API endpoint can return these errors.

error_codes:
  - code: ACCOUNT_CLOSED
    status: 422
    error_type: rule-violation
    markdown_doc: |
      You have requested a financial transaction on an account that is closed.
      For an account to be able to transact it must be in a good state and not frozen.

  - code: ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND
    status: 400
    error_type: not-found
    markdown_doc: |
      You made a POST/PUT/PATCH request whose request body refers to an account,
      but the specified account does not exist.

  - code: APPLICATION_NOT_FOUND
    status: 400
    error_type: not-found
    markdown_doc: |
      You made a POST/PUT/PATCH request whose request body refers to an application,
      but the specified application does not exist.

  # hmmmm: mainapi's clients/plaid package returns BAD_REQUEST_QUERY; probably
  # need a hack in that package to switch the error code between v0 and v1
  - code: BAD_QUERY_PARAMETER
    status: 400
    error_type: bad-request-query
    title: Bad Request Query Parameter
    markdown_doc: |
      Your request had a problem with its query parameters.
      Most commonly, this is due to an invalid value for one query parameter,
      but it could also be caused by an invalid combination of query parameters,
      or a missing query parameter.
      See the `detail` string for a complete explanation.

  - code: BAD_REQUEST
    status: 400
    error_type: bad-request
    markdown_doc: |
      There is a generic, unspecified problem with your request.
      See the `detail` field for more information.
      This is typically a problem with the URL or the request headers.
      This usually indicates a problem with your client implementation.

  - code: BAD_REQUEST_BODY
    status: 400
    error_type: bad-request-body
    markdown_doc: |
      You sent a POST/PUT/PATCH request with a JSON request body, but the body is not valid.
      There are many possible reasons for this:
        * Some required fields might be missing
        * Some fields might have invalid types or values
        * Some fields might be immutable
        * Something else that is more complex than simply missing/invalid fields

      Missing, invalid, or immutable request fields will be described by extra fields
      of this error response: `missing`, `invalid`, and `immutable`.
    extra_fields:
      missing:
        type: array
        description: |
          List of required field names that are not present in the request.
        items:
          type: string
      invalid:
        type: object
        description: |
          Mapping from field name to error message that explains why that field is invalid.
          The error messages are English-only and are intended to explain to an API integrator,
          not an end user, why this value is invalid.
      immutable:
        type: array
        description: |
          List of field names that are not allowed to be modified.
        items:
          type: string

  - code: BUSINESS_NOT_FOUND
    status: 400
    error_type: not-found
    markdown_doc: |

      but the specified business does not exist.

  - code: CUSTOMER_NOT_FOUND
    status: 400
    error_type: not-found
    markdown_doc: |
      You made a POST/PUT/PATCH request whose request body refers to a customer,
      but the specified customer does not exist.

  # Do not confuse FEATURE_NOT_AVAILABLE with NOT_IMPLEMENTED. If a feature is
  # not available, it's implemented and tested and works ... but it's not
  # available to this client right now.
  - code: FEATURE_NOT_AVAILABLE
    status: 400
    error_type: bad-request
    markdown_doc: |
      You attempted to access some feature of the Synctera platform that is not available to you.
      There are various possible reasons for this:
        - Your contract does not include this functionality.
        - A third-party vendor does not support this functionality.
      See the `detail` string for a complete explanation.

  - code: UNAUTHENTICATED
    status: 401
    error_type: unauthenticated
    markdown_doc: |
      You made a request with invalid, incomplete, or missing authentication credentials.
      The standard way to authenticate to Synctera's API is with an API key passed as a bearer token.
      For example, you should include an HTTP request header like

          Authorization: Bearer 533a9bd0-8dd2-4e13-8d7c-73d9c1b4b9b6

      (with your actual API key, of course).
