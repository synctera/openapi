  description: |
    Initiate a Punchout schedule step that this service is responsible for. If the step key is
    registered to this endpoint, the service will respond in one of two ways:

      1. Return 200 OK with details about the attempt result, if the step was completed
      synchronously.

      2. Return 202 Accepted without details, if the attempt must be done asynchronously. The
      service will call Punchout back later once the step is complete, with details.
